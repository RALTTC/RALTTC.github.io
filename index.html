<p>
The RAL Table Tennis Club's (RAL TTC) roots go back to the mid sixties when the 
Rutherford and Atlas Labs were establishing and developing on site. <br>
The RAL TT Club is probably one of the longest surviving clubs on 
the RAL site and is still very active.</p>
<h2><A NAME="Affiliation">Affiliation</A></h2>
<P>
The club is affiliated to the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Recreational 
Society (RAL RecSoc). This society looks after many aspects of all the clubs on this 
site, including the RecSoc buildings, lounge etc.<B><h2><A NAME="Objectives">Objectives</A></h2></B> </P>
<table class="top-noborder" width="100%" border="0" id="table1">
  <tr>
    <td>The RAL TT Club objectives are:
      <p>(a) To promote and encourage the playing of table tennis at the 
        Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. </p>
      <p>(b) To organise table tennis competitions and associated 
        functions. </p>
      <p>(c) To enter table tennis teams into local leagues.</td>

<h2><A NAME="Membership">Membership</A></h2>
<P>
RAL TT Club membership is open to all Full and Associate members of
the RecSoc. The Club's annual membership subscription is Â£3. This membership fee 
goes towards maintaining good standard table tennis tables and other auxiliary 
table tennis equipment. Information on <A HREF="#Join">how to join</A> is available below.<br>

  <tr>
    <td>We are a small and friendly club, keen to attract new members to 
      play. All standards of player are welcome from complete beginners 
      through to advanced, so why not come along and join us. Playing 
      table tennis is a fun and sociable sport which is excellent for 
      improving general fitness.<i><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: black; font-family: Palatino Linotype"> </span></i>
                  <p>For all prospective new members, joining is simple.</p>
      <p><strong> (a)</strong> All you need to do is to come along one lunchtime to 
        the table tennis club room in building R58 and have a look around 
        and if possible speak to the players that might be there; or maybe 
        bring a like minded friend who is also interested in table tennis 
        with you and bring your own bat and ball. Feel free to start playing 
        table tennis. Switch on the flood lighting when playing and at the 
        end of the table tennis session please switch off the flood lighting 
        before leaving.</p>
      <p>The idea is that potential new members can try out playing table 
        tennis at the RAL TT club. These visits can last for a few weeks 
        before actually joining and paying the annual club subscription.</p>
      <p><strong>(b)</strong> Another way is to telephone anyone on the 
        RAL TT Club committee, who can then make arrangements to meet you in 
        the club room and to show you around and explain how the club is set 
        up etc.</p>
      <p><strong>(c)</strong> Fill in and return the <a href="Application form for membership.doc"> club membership application form</a>.      
    <p>Remember you must also be a Full or Associate member of the RAL Rec Soc. </td>

<h2><A NAME="General">General</A></h2>
<P>
Our club has an annually elected Executive Committee which runs the affairs of 
the club to a set procedure governed by the Club Rules with its Constitution and 
Annual General Meeting/Extraordinary Meeting proceedings etc. The AGM is held in 
June. Within this framework our club operates on two main fronts viz. (a) 
Lunchtime Table Tennis and (b) Evening League Table Tennis. </P>
<h2><A NAME="Facilities">Facilities</A></h2>
	<table class="top-noborder" width="100%" border="0" id="table2">
		<tr>
			<td>The facilities we have for the RAL TT Club are all located 
			within the RecSoc building R58, which is the building closest to the 
			12-metre antenna satellite dish on the south side of the RAL site. 
			The facilities at RAL for table tennis are among the best in the 
			Didcot &amp; Oxford areas.<p>We have an excellent club room which has 
			enough floor space for two tables with dedicated flood lighting over 
			each table. </p>
			<p>Some bats and balls are usually available in the cupboard, 
			however most participants find it beneficial to bring their own 
			table tennis bat which they are more familiar with, and to bring 
			some balls in case there are not enough around. Players are 
			recommended to bring sports shoes to get a better grip while playing 
			and avoid leaving marks or dirt on the floor.</p>
			<p>We also use the larger Sports Hall in the evening. This room also 
			has dedicated flood lighting and is used mainly for league matches. It is booked out to our club to cover for scheduled 
			match nights etc. The match table is meant for league use only. </p>
			<p>R58 has a lounge. Male and female changing rooms 
			with shower facilities are located in the amenities building next door.</td>

			<td>Essentially all the table tennis club facilities are available 
			to all club members who wish to play table tennis in the lunch 
			period. Lunchtime table tennis is great fun, a pleasant way to keep 
			fit and it can reduce stress. Lunchtime table tennis at RAL runs all 
			through the year, though it is often too hot in July and August.
			  <p>
			Lunchtime table tennis is run informally depending what the 
			participants want and how many come to a particular session. 
			Typically, we would play singles and stay on the table for two games 
			then let the next player have two games, this way it works out like 
			a round robin approach to games which ensures that everyone has a go 
			and meets different players. It can have a competitive edge if you 
			want it to or at other times it could be stroke play 
			practice etc. However, if the club room was crowded then we would go 
			for playing doubles.</p>
			<p>We also run box leagues which can be played at lunchtimes if wanted. See 
			<a href="#Box">box league</a> section below for more information.
			</p>
			<p>Table tennis is a very skilful sport at the highest level. 
			However, all standards of player from complete beginners through to 
			the various levels in local table tennis league divisions are 
			welcome. So it does not matter what standard you are, you are most 
			welcome. You will be surprised how well your playing skills will 
			improve with practice. If you wanted to develop your playing skills 
			further you could consider playing evening league table tennis.            
		    <h2><A NAME="Box">Box League</a></h2>
		    <p>The main 
		      objective of the league is to provide social exchange between 
		      players of similar standard. All standards are catered for from 
		      beginners to experienced players.</p>

			<td background="Table Tennis Club report to Rec Soc AGM 12.doc">The RAL TT Club has been entering teams into the local leagues 
			continuously since the mid sixties.
			<a href="http://www.ddtta.org.uk/">Didcot &amp; District Table Tennis 
			Association</a> league is the main league we enter. We also enter the 
			<a href="https://www.tabletennis365.com/Oxford">Oxford &amp; District Table Tennis Association </a>league when we have the 
			appropriate players. Both are affiliated to the
			<a href="http://tabletennisengland.co.uk/">Table Tennis 
			England</a>. Our teams are made up from <i>Full RecSoc Members</i> 
			and <i>Associate Members </i>from outside RAL.
			<p>Table 
			Tennis is a winter sport so the league fixtures season runs from 
			September until April. A team consists of 3 players which are picked 
			usually from a larger squad of say 4 or 5 players registered for 
			that team. These additional players cover when arrangements clash or 
			for sickness etc.; it also caters for those players who want to play 
			occasionally for the team.</p>
			<p>There are usually 10 to 12 teams in a division; each team plays 
			home and away. This means about 22 evening league matches are played 
			throughout the season. The league also runs two handicap 
			competitions (optional) and tournaments, which means a few more matches may be 
			played. </p>
			<p>The committee runs the evening league side of our club and 
			individual team captains run the teams. Therefore, for those 
			interested players who would like to take part in more serious table 
			tennis play, then evening league maybe the answer. It has the best 
			of both worlds, it has that competitive edge, yet it also has a 
			friendly and sociable side. It is a way of meeting a network of new 
			friends.
